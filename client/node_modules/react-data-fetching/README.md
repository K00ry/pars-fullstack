`react-data-fetching` provides a very intuitive way to perform any REST API call without hassle, through a single React component. It also helps you take care of timeouts, loading states, errors handling, data saving, uploading/downloading progress, etc. Fetching data while letting the user know what's going on has never been that easy!

The package is really lightweight (~6 kB gzipped) and has been built from the ground up with universal apps in mind: you can use it wherever React is rendering - meaning it works seamlessly with React (web) & React Native!

## Installation

Using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```shell
$ yarn add react-data-fetching
```

Then, use it as you would with anything else:

```js
// using ES6 modules
import { Fetch } from 'react-data-fetching'

// using CommonJS modules
var Fetch = require('react-data-fetching').Fetch
```

The UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-data-fetching/umd/react-data-fetching.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.ReactDataFetching`.

## Usage

The following illustrates the simplest way to use `react-data-fetching`:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { Fetch } from 'react-data-fetching'

import { Loader } from './components'

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Fetch
        loader={<Loader />} // Replace this with your lovely handcrafted loader
        url="https://api.github.com/users/octocat"
        timeout={5000}
      >
        {({ data }) => (
          <div>
            <h1>Username</h1>
            <p>{data.name}</p>
          </div>
        )}
      </Fetch>
    )
  }
}
```

The package gives access to `<Fetch>`, `<FetchProvider>` and `requestToApi()`.

## Todo

Want to submit a PR but don't know where to start? Here is a list of features you could consider! This might change in the future as the API is far from being complete.

- [x] Add compatibility to React 16.3.0+ lifecycles ‚öõÔ∏è
- [x] Implement React 16.3.0+ new context API ‚öõÔ∏è
- [ ] Add an `/examples` folder for newcomers & contributors üìÇ
- [ ] Add the ability to run multiple fetches serially or in parallel ‚õì
- [ ] Implement a caching system (through React's Suspense?) üì•
- [ ] What else?
